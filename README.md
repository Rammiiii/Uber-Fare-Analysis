# ðŸš– Uber Fare Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This project analyzes Uber ride data to identify key factors that affect fare amounts. 
The workflow includes data import, cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and building predictive machine learning models.

---

## 2. Data Import
- Imported libraries: **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, sklearn**.  
- Loaded dataset `final_internship_data.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.

---

## 3. Data Cleaning
- **Removed duplicates** to ensure unique records.  
- **Handled missing values** by dropping rows with nulls.  
- **Filtered invalid fares**:
  - Removed fares under `$0` (not realistic).  
  - Kept fares within a reasonable range (`$3 â€“ $30`).  
- **Checked for outliers** in numerical columns such as `fare_amount` and `distance`.

---

## 4. Data Preprocessing
- **Categorical Features**:
  - Encoded categorical variables (`Weather`, `Car Condition`, `Traffic Condition`) using **One-Hot Encoding**.  
- **Numerical Features**:
  - Standardized numerical variables (e.g., `distance`, `year`) using **StandardScaler**.  
- **Target Variable**:
  - `fare_amount` was separated from the feature set (X) to be predicted by models.

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Key Visualizations & Findings:
1. **Car Condition vs. Fare**  
   - Boxplots showed little to no impact of car condition on fare.  

2. **Distance vs. Fare**  
   - Strong **positive relationship**: fares increase with distance.  

3. **Passenger Count**  
   - Around **70% of rides had only 1 passenger**.  

4. **Time of Day**  
   - Highest fares occurred around **5 AM**.  

5. **Day of Week**  
   - **Monday** had the highest ride requests.  

6. **Fare Range**  
   - Most fares fall between **$3 and $30**.

## 6. Machine Learning Models
### Linear Regression
- Built a **multiple linear regression** model.  
- Result: Captured trends but limited accuracy due to non-linear relationships.  

### Random Forest Regression
- Trained a **Random Forest model** for better accuracy.  
- Benefits:  
  - Handles non-linearity better.  
  - Less sensitive to outliers.  
  - Higher accuracy compared to linear regression.  

---

## 7. Model Workflow
1. Split dataset into **training (80%) and testing (20%)**.  
2. Applied preprocessing (encoding + scaling).  
3. Trained models:
   - **Linear Regression** (baseline model).  
   - **Random Forest Regressor** (improved model).  
4. Evaluated model performance using **RÂ² score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.  

---

## 8. Results
- **Car condition**: not a major factor in fare prediction.  
- **Distance**: most significant predictor.  
- **Passenger count**: majority are single-passenger rides.  
- **Time and day**: Fares peak around **5 AM** and requests are higher on **Mondays**.  
- **Modeling**:
  - Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression.  

---

## 9. Conclusion
- Uber fare prediction is primarily influenced by **distance** and **time factors**.  
- Car condition and traffic had minor influence.  
- Random Forest is a suitable model for predicting fares compared to simple regression.
